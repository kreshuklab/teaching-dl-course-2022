# Exercises for Webinar 1

The exercise for the first webinar will refresh your image analysis knowledge and teach basic image analysis methods in python with scikit-image.
Please finish the following exercise before the first webinar:
- `image_analysis.ipynb`: image analysis refresher on data from the Kaggle Data Science Bowl for nucleus segmentation. [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/constantinpape/dl-teaching-resources/blob/main/exercises/image_analysis/image_analysis.ipynb).

If you are familiar with image analysis with scikit-image already you can also skip this exercise.
