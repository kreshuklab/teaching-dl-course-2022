# Exercises for Webinar 2

We provide exercises for pytorch and keras.

## Pytorch

Exercises for Image Classification with pytorch. Contains the following exercises:
- `pytorch/1_data_preparation`: pytorch dataloader for classification. [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/constantinpape/dl-teaching-resources/blob/main/exercises/classification/1_data_preperation.ipynb).
- `pytorch/2_logistic_regression`: image classification with a simple logistic regression model. [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/constantinpape/dl-teaching-resources/blob/main/exercises/classification/2_logistic_regression.ipynb).
- `pytorch/3_multi_layer_perceptron`: image classification with a multi-layer perceptron. [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/constantinpape/dl-teaching-resources/blob/main/exercises/classification/3_multi_layer_perceptron.ipynb).

All the exercises use the [CIFAR10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
For the pytorch exercises, please use the `DL Course(Pytorch)` environment in BAND. You can start it via `Applications->Programming->DL Course(Pytorch)`.

## tensorflow/keras

Here we will perform a simple classification task that will show you the basics of using tensorflow/keras.  

- `keras/classification_simple_keras.ipynb`: Basic demonstration of a feature classification example with a Multi layer perceptron (MLP) using tensorflow/keras

For the keras exercises, please use the `DL Course(Keras)` environment in BAND. You can start it via `Applications->Programming->DL Course(Keras)`.

## Content

These exercises will cover basic machine learning and computer vision concepts relevant for image classification.
You can find lectute notes recapping these contents ([here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PNoyDIemKKE7Eo02txJfY0kge7tqlrWB1EY9USK4OGY/edit?usp=sharing)), covering:
