# Exercises for Webinar1

We provide exercises for pytorch and keras. TODO recommend which exercises participants should do.

## Pytorch

Exercises for Image Classification with pytorch. Contains the following exercises:
- `1_data_preparation`: pytorch dataloader for classification. [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/constantinpape/dl-teaching-resources/blob/main/exercises/classification/1_data_preperation.ipynb).
- `2_logistic_regression`: image classification with a simple logistic regression model. [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/constantinpape/dl-teaching-resources/blob/main/exercises/classification/2_logistic_regression.ipynb).
- `3_multi_layer_perceptron`: image classification with a multi-layer perceptron. [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/constantinpape/dl-teaching-resources/blob/main/exercises/classification/3_multi_layer_perceptron.ipynb).

All the exercises use the [CIFAR10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

## Content

These exercises will cover basic machine learning and computer vision concepts relevant for image classification.
You can find lectute notes recapping these contents ([here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PNoyDIemKKE7Eo02txJfY0kge7tqlrWB1EY9USK4OGY/edit?usp=sharing)), covering:

- Machine Learning Basics
    - Supervised Learning
    - Artificial Neural Networks
    - Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Computer Vision Basics
    - Tasks: Image Classification, Object Detection and Segmentation
    - Computer vision with preset features and shallow learning
    - Preview of feature learning and CNNs
- Deep Learning Frameworks
    - Why do we need deep learning frameworks?
    - Overview of the popular frameworks
