# Exercises for Webinar 3

We provide exercises for pytorch and keras. Please try to work on both exercises to get an understanding of both libraries.

## Pytorch

In the first two exercises we follow up on the exercises from webinar2 and implement a CNN and data augmentation for image classification on the cifar dataset.
The last exercise provides an introduction to image segmentation with a U-net to prepare us for one of the course and introduce a very important method for bioimage analysis.
- `pytorch/1_data_preparation`: pytorch dataloader for classification. [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/constantinpape/dl-teaching-resources/blob/main/exercises/classification/4_cnn.ipynb).
- `pytorch/2_logistic_regression`: image classification with a simple logistic regression model. [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/constantinpape/dl-teaching-resources/blob/main/exercises/classification/5_data_augmentation.ipynb).
- `pytorch/3_multi_layer_perceptron`: image classification with a multi-layer perceptron. [Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/constantinpape/dl-teaching-resources/blob/main/exercises/segmentation/unet2d.ipynb).
